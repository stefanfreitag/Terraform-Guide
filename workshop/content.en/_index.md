## Introduction

During the last five years I started to look more and more into Infrastructure
as Code (IaC) and Everything as Code (EaC).
With AWS in focus the Cloud Development Kit played a key role and still is.
Inbetween I also looked into other "flavours" like Pulumi and Terraform.

Here I would like to share what I learned so far using Terraform.
